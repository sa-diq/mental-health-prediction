# mental-health-prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict mental health conditions. By processing data points such as behavioral patterns, demographic information, lifestyle factors, and self-reported symptoms, the model helps identify potential mental health risks and outcomes. This tool can be valuable for healthcare professionals and researchers in understanding mental health trends and early intervention opportunities.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of mental health datasets
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Implementation of multiple ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Feature importance analysis
- Cross-validation and model performance metrics
- Interactive prediction interface



## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Streamlit for web interface
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis
